# Kahoot Quiz Generator

## About

A basic React app that uses the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) to retrieve a list of multiple choice quiz questions.

The app uses the [SheetJS](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) library to build a [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com) compatible Excel File (XLSX).

Download the generated excel file and then upload it to Kahoot to create a quiz.
